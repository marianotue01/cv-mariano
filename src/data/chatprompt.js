File: chatprompt.js
Summary:
- Input: None directly; imports CV data from `data.js`.
- Process:
  1. Imports all relevant CV data: about, core competencies, experience, certifications, education, languages.
  2. Exports a function `generateSystemPrompt` that builds a single formatted string.
  3. The string is designed as a system prompt for a chatbot, instructing it to:
     - Identify itself as an expert on Mariano Tuero's career.
     - Always mention "Mariano" explicitly at the start of responses.
     - Use the imported CV data to answer questions accurately.
  4. Each section of the CV (About, Core Competencies, Experience, Certifications, Education, Languages) is formatted clearly with bullets or structured text.
- Output: A single string representing the complete system prompt for AI or chatbot usage.
