Emphasize how your experience in financial environments, critical platforms, and mainframes positions you to effectively integrate into modernization and data integrity projects.
Technical and Situational Questions You Might Be Asked â€” with Suggested Answers:
Technical:
1.	Have you worked with data integration from legacy platforms to cloud or analytics systems? Describe a case and how you solved it.
â†’ Yes, I have led several projects integrating legacy systems (not necessarily mainframe) with modern analytics and cloud automation platforms.
o	At J.P. Morgan, our team developed and maintained a microservices architecture called NETLs (Network ETL Services) for the ingestion, transformation, and exposure of data from legacy systems, including syslog logs, SNMP traps, and flat files.
o	These NETL microservices, built mainly in Java and Python, were deployed in Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes. Data ingestion was handled with Kafka Connect, transformations were done using Apache Kafka Streams, and data exposure was managed through REST APIs exposed by Amazon API Gateway.
o	Transformed data was stored in MongoDB, enabling efficient queries and later consumed by Splunk for visualization, monitoring, and alert generation. Event-driven triggers were set up on Kafka topics for near real-time processing.
o	At ExxonMobil, I led the development of an automation product for deploying FlexLM licenses, built on .NET Core and deployed using PaaS services from Microsoft Azure, such as Azure App Service. This product automated the assignment and activation of FlexLM licenses on local or global license servers using REST APIs for cloud management and monitoring.
2.	What tools or strategies do you use to maintain quality and governance of technical content on platforms?
ðŸ§© 1. Content Preservation Workstream
â€¢	Worked on legal, regulatory, and audit content that was highly sensitive in terms of compliance.
â€¢	Implemented automated versioning and role-based access control (RBAC).
â€¢	Set up a controlled retention system to prevent critical documents from being deleted by standard editors.
o	AEM Assets for versioning and retention.
o	Azure Active Directory + AEM groups for access control.
o	Change auditing through AEM logs and traceability in Azure DevOps.
ðŸ§© 2. Metadata Governance and Taxonomy
â€¢	Atlas handles thousands of documents that need to be classified by standard, industry, jurisdiction, and fiscal year. Led Intelligent Content Management: defined ontologies and hierarchies that improved semantic search in Atlas.
â€¢	Defined a structured metadata model with mandatory properties like Document Type, Accounting Standard, Region, Effective Date, and Lifecycle Status.
o	Used AEM Content Fragments with JSON schema to enforce metadata structure.
o	Automated validations with AEM Workflows + Groovy scripts to prevent content publication without metadata.
o	Defined hierarchical taxonomy in JSON, consumed by Atlasâ€™s semantic search component.
ðŸ§© 3. CMS Migration (Ovitas â†’ AEM)
â€¢	Migrated technical content from Ovitas CMS (based on DITA/XML) to Adobe Experience Manager.
â€¢	Automated conversion of DITA content to HTML5, maintaining semantic structure and internal links.
â€¢	Implemented approval workflows in AEM for content publication.
o	Migration with custom Python and Groovy scripts integrating Ovitas and AEM APIs.
o	Integrated with Azure DevOps Pipelines for version control and templates.
o	Implemented automated auditing for SOX compliance and internal audit standards.

3.	How did you migrate a monolithic platform to AEM from a previous CMS?
â†’ I started with a thorough requirements evaluation, planning workstreams, performing tests, coordinating cross-functional teams, and ensuring a smooth production deployment.
o	The migration included a detailed analysis of the existing CMS features and content types, followed by mapping them to AEM components.
o	We defined workflows for content approval, established a rollback strategy, and executed phased data migrations to ensure minimal downtime and risk.
o	A key focus was optimizing AEMâ€™s multi-site capabilities, ensuring that all content was correctly migrated and structured for future scalability.
4.	How would you ensure data integrity during a migration from mainframe systems?
â†’ I use automated validations, comparative scripts, and checksum processes in event-driven architectures (like we did at JPMorgan).
o	I establish business rules with stakeholders to ensure that both the semantic and structural integrity of the data is maintained.
o	Data is validated at every step of the migration process to ensure that no discrepancies are introduced, and comprehensive logging and monitoring are implemented to track any issues.
5.	Have you worked with CDC (Change Data Capture)? How did you implement it, and what benefits did it bring?
â†’ At JPMorgan, we used CDC with an event-driven architecture to capture changes in network devices and propagate them to microservices with high reliability and minimal latency.
o	CDC allowed us to perform near-real-time replication and monitoring of data across legacy systems and new cloud-based solutions, significantly improving data consistency and reducing latency in reporting.
6.	What considerations do you take into account when planning a migration of VSAM or IMS data to S3 or HDFS?
â†’ I focus on defining data mappings, running pilot migrations with subsets of data, performing checksum validations, aligning schemas, and establishing metadata governance.
o	I also ensure version control and performance testing in staging environments to ensure that data migration occurs smoothly and without issues.
7.	How did you manage performance or latency in a hybrid mainframe-cloud architecture?
â†’ I balanced batch operations and real-time streaming, utilizing intelligent caching and compartmentalized APIs.
o	Prioritizing critical endpoints, while ensuring the data integrity and ensuring near real-time processing capabilities without overwhelming system resources, was key.
8.	What strategies do you use to improve data quality in legacy systems?
â†’ I conduct data audits, incremental cleaning, define functional validation rules, and provide continuous reporting via Power BI.
o	Regular feedback from stakeholders is essential to prevent recurring errors, and I focus on creating clear reporting metrics for ongoing improvements.
